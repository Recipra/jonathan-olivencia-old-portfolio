Jonathan Olivencia's Portfolio!

As the title suggests, this is my portfolio! Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application displays my technical skill in a manner that allows recruiters to get a feel of how I code. It has an intro page, an about section, an area with my contact info, my resume, and a cool carousel displaying my projects with working links! There are some neat user interactions, and a hidden easter egg that does something kinda cool!
